## Installing Debian

Insatlled live debian using the Virtual Machiines. I ran into few problems during the installation
- First problem I ran into during the installation was the warning of "Please use a kernel appropirate for your CPU". Here is the Screenshot ![Fail_to_install_debian](https://github.com/Bishwasghimire-AA/mymarkdownexecrise/assets/144313610/053a88a7-27f3-4ce8-b289-5c84da0e3f5f)

  I fixed this problem manually by changing the debian file to 64-bit, and it worked
- Second problem I ran into was problem with logging in after debian was installed. Even though I had provided the correct username and paseord it keot on giving me warning for incorrect password. Here is the screenshot of the warning ![Incorrect_password_warning](https://github.com/Bishwasghimire-AA/mymarkdownexecrise/assets/144313610/0d12dd5c-8ff9-412f-a3a5-33f9278297ee)
  
  This problem got fixed after uninsatlling and reinstalling the debian about 3 times from my virtual machine.
- Finally I'm able to have my own Linux OS in my VM. I followed all the insatllation guide provided in Tero's [Website](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/)

 And here's how my desktop works after the final tweaking.![my_debian](https://github.com/Bishwasghimire-AA/mymarkdownexecrise/assets/144313610/aba1e167-7aeb-4e5a-b6e9-5b8719d4a95a)
