### My summary of [Threat modeling manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified and enumerated, and countermeasures prioritized even before the system is build. TThe best use of threat modeling is to improve the security and privacy of a system through early and frequent analysis. Threat modeling is based on four key questions,
* What are we working on ?
* What can go wrong ?
* What are we going to do about it ?
* Did we do a good enough job ?

Threat modeling manifesto identifies two key guidelines, **values** and **principles**.
