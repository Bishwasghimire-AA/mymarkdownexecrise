### My summary of [Threat modeling manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified and enumerated, and countermeasures prioritized even before the system is build. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling is based on four key questions,
* What are we working on ?
* What can go wrong ?
* What are we going to do about it ?
* Did we do a good enough job ?
