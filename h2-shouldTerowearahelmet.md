# H2 - Threat Modeling Summary and My Own Threat Model

## x) Read/watch and summarize

### My summary of [Threat modeling manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified and enumerated, and countermeasures prioritized even before the system is build. TThe best use of threat modeling is to improve the security and privacy of a system through early and frequent analysis. Threat modeling is based on four key questions,
* What are we working on ?
* What can go wrong ?
* What are we going to do about it ?
* Did we do a good enough job ?

All these questions will be explained on the [following](https://github.com/bishwasghimire22/mymarkdownexecrise/blob/main/h2-shouldTerowearahelmet.md#summary-on-worlds-shortest-threat-modeling-course) summary

Threat modeling manifesto identifies two key guidelines, **values** and **principles**.

* Threat modeling is done to anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them, before the system build where changes can be made quickly and easily.
* Key questions for threat modeling
  - What are we working on ?
  - 
      Its best to collabrate with people working on the project in different area(coding,networking etc.) and discuss on the model together and start making sketches or diagrams. It's good practice to record your documents as we are working on it, it will help identify what can go wrong.
  - What can go wrong ?
    
     Here we start to think "what can go wrong". We kneed to check all the vulnebrility in the system. Diffrent tools like STRIDE, kill-chain, etc. can be used as a guide to get answers. All the answers we get should be paid equal attention. Basically, think like a bad person is going to think.
    
  - What are we going to do about it ?

      We answer this question by collecting all the threats during the "what can go wrong" question and fix those threats by asigning the  task to the related individuals. We use risk management if the threat can't be resolved, risk management decides weather to accept or transfer the risk or thret.

  - Did we do a good job ?
