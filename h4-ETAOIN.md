## Encrypting and Decrypting a Message

For this task I choose to use [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/index.html), also known as GPG. It is an open source and free tool which allows us to encrypt
and sign your data and communications. It features a versatile key management system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key directories. GPG already comes installed in our debian OS.
![Gpg_version](https://github.com/bishwasghimire22/mymarkdownexecrise/assets/144313610/e02941f3-22a0-4a53-bf1f-535376d21c59)

Steps to send and recieve encrypted message will will require trust for both sender and reciever. This is done by setting a key pair of own and sharing the public key. Help for this task was recieved from [PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/?fromSearch=gpg).

First I create a key pair for myself uaing the following command
    gpg --full-generate-key
