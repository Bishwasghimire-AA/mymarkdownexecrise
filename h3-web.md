# Summary from [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) and [OWASP Webgoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/)

[OWASP](https://owasp.org/about/)(Open Worldwide Application Security Project) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. The OWASP Top ten is a list of the ten most critical web application security risks. It provides an awareness and guidance to developers and security professionals on common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. This list is formed by contribution of people from different IT fields like Data scientists, web designer, Translators, Testing guide, and code review guide etc. and the Internet community. I am going to summarize few catagories from the list below.
